<--- Issues -->

in conversation page, pressing back after posting a comment creates a problem! ----->> SOLVED! BUT CHECK FOR SIMILAR ISSUES( had to use HttpResponseRedirect)

after clicking a new notification, it takes to conversation view and then clicking back the notification is still new. 
also the nav bar should be aligned!
